To get your `YOUR_BOT_APP_ID` and `YOUR_BOT_APP_PASSWORD`, you'll need to register your bot with the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new). Here are the steps to do that:

**1. Sign in to the Azure Portal:**

- Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Microsoft account.

**2. Register a new bot:**

- Obsolete: Navigate to "Create a resource" > "AI + Machine Learning" > "Bot Channels Registration".
- Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Azure Bot".
- Fill out the required fields:
  - **Bot handle:** A unique name for your bot.
  - **Subscription:** Choose your Azure subscription.
  - **Resource group:** Create a new resource group or use an existing one.
  - **Location:** Choose a location close to you.
  - **Pricing tier:** Choose the free tier (F0) for now.

**3. Configure messaging endpoint:**

- For the messaging endpoint, enter `http://localhost:3978/api/messages` (you can change this later when you deploy your bot to a server).

**4. Create the bot:**

- Click "Review + create" and then "Create" to finish the registration process.

**5. Get the app ID and password:**

- Once the bot is created, go to the resource and navigate to the "Settings" blade.
- Under the "Configuration" tab, you'll find the "Microsoft App ID". Copy this value and replace `YOUR_BOT_APP_ID` in your code.
- To get the "Microsoft App Password", click on "Manage" next to the "Microsoft App ID", which will take you to the Azure AD app registration page.
- Click on "Certificates & secrets" on the left-hand side and then on "New client secret".
- Enter a description and choose an expiry period, then click "Add".
- Copy the value of the client secret and replace `YOUR_BOT_APP_PASSWORD` in your code. Make sure to store it securely as you won't be able to view it again.

With these credentials, your bot will be able to authenticate and communicate with the Microsoft Bot Framework. Let me know if there's anything else you need!
